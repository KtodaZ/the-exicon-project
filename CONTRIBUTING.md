# Contributing to The Exicon Project

Thank you for your interest in **The Exicon Project**!

This is a community-led effort to build an open source exercise lexicon for the F3 Nation. Whether you're here to help define structure, suggest formatting ideas, or just want to be part of the early planning conversations — you're in the right place.

## How to Get Involved

Since the project is still in its early stages, the best way to contribute is to join the conversation and help shape the foundation.

### 1. **Join the Discussion**

Connect with other PAX on our official Discord:
**[https://discord.gg/qUKbvs7cx2](https://discord.gg/qUKbvs7cx2)**

This is where we’re talking about everything from structure and terminology to long-term vision.

### 2. **Watch this Repo**

We’ll post GitHub issues as the project takes shape — including small tasks, design discussions, and early development work. You can use GitHub’s Watch feature to stay in the loop.

## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and supportive. This project is rooted in the spirit of F3 — leave no man behind, but leave no man where you found him.
