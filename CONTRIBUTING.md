# Contributing to The Exicon Project

Thank you for your interest in **The Exicon Project**!

This is a community effort to build and maintain the F3 exercise lexicon (Exicon) and terminology. Our mission is to help Qs share workouts, learn F3 language, and grow the traditions of the F3 Nation.

## What is the Exicon?

The Exicon is named exercises used in F3 workouts, each with instructions, stories, and traditions. We also maintain a lexicon of F3 terminology - from PAX to Qs to beatdowns. This helps Qs bring consistency and fun to workouts while honoring F3 culture.
