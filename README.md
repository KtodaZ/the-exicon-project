# The Exicon Project

**An open source exercise lexicon for F3 Qs ‚Äî built by the PAX, for the PAX.**  

The Exicon Project is a community-driven effort to build, refine, and maintain an up-to-date exercise lexicon (Exicon) for F3 workouts. 
This project provides a platform for Qs across regions to contribute new routines, update existing entries, and share the creative fitness traditions of the F3 Nation.

## üìö What is the Exicon?
The Exicon is a collection of named exercises used in F3 workouts, often paired with a unique story, method, or tradition. It helps Qs (leaders) bring consistency, creativity, and fun to beatdowns while honoring F3's culture and mission.

You can view the official Exicon at [f3nation.com/Exicon](https://f3nation.com/Exicon).  

This project aims to build an open, extensible version of that resource.
